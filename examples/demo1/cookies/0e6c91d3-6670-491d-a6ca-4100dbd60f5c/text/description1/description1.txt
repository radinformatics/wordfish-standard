This appears to be a picture of some kind of dried fruit. There are thirteen pieces, and the color appears orange for some on the left, and more yellow for some on the right. The background is some kind of corkboard, and combined with the reddish light, might make the color of the fruit seem more orange. There appears to be a sugar coating around the outside, which is typical of dried fruits!
